# DeepLearning-MSc-Portfolio

This repository contains the assignments and group projects completed as part of my Master’s-level **Deep Learning** course at VU Amsterdam. It serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing hands-on experience with core deep learning concepts, model implementation, and practical experimentation. After successfully completing the course, I continued as a Teaching Assistant, and this repository now also serves as a reference and teaching tool.

## Purpose

This repository has two roles:

1. **Portfolio of my academic work**  
   It showcases the practical skills and projects I developed throughout the course.

2. **Teaching resource**  
   As a Teaching Assistant, I use this repo to:
   - Explain deep learning concepts to students  
   - Provide examples and guidance for implementing models  
   - Help students debug their code  
   - Answer questions related to the course and assignments
